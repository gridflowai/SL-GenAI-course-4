    "#### Medical Diagnosis Using Self-Consistency: How Voting Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario**: \n",
    "In a medical diagnosis example, self-consistency uses multiple reasoning paths to derive the most likely outcome. The \"voting\" process involves determining which reasoning path is most consistent with the provided data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How the Voting Happens\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multiple Reasoning Paths**:  \n",
    "   The LLM generates several independent reasoning paths or chains of thought based on the query and the patient's medical context.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Aggregation of Answers**:  \n",
    "   - The outputs from all reasoning paths are collected.  \n",
    "   - If most paths converge on a specific diagnosis (e.g., \"diabetes\"), that diagnosis is selected as the most consistent and likely correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Consistency as a Metric**:  \n",
    "   - The \"winning\" diagnosis is chosen based on the highest frequency of agreement among all reasoning paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Who Votes\n",
    "\n",
    "- The \"voters\" are the individual reasoning paths generated by the LLM.  \n",
    "- These paths are produced by prompting the LLM multiple times using slight variations (e.g., different random seeds or temperature settings).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conflict Resolution**:  \n",
    "   - If reasoning paths produce conflicting diagnoses, the consistency of their steps is analyzed.  \n",
    "   - The final output reflects the majority's reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Human Validation** (if needed):  \n",
    "   - Medical experts can review the LLM’s reasoning for accuracy and plausibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **External Validation Layers**:  \n",
    "   - Systems may implement structured rules or knowledge bases to cross-check the LLM's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of Self-Consistency for Medical Diagnosis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robustness**: Helps ensure the diagnosis is not a result of a single flawed reasoning path.  \n",
    "- **Transparency**: Provides multiple perspectives on the problem.  \n",
    "- **Scalability**: Automates consistency checks across large datasets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach relies on generating diverse reasoning pathways and filtering for the majority consensus to ensure the LLM considers all relevant factors.\n"

      "Reasoning Paths:\n",
      "\n",
      "Path 1:\n",
      "Based on the provided context, let's analyze the symptoms and history step by step:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Symptoms**:\n",
      "   - **Fatigue**: Common in many conditions, but particularly in diabetes due to poor glucose utilization.\n",
      "   - **Weight Loss**: Unintentional weight loss can occur in uncontrolled diabetes as the body starts breaking down fat and muscle for energy when it cannot utilize glucose properly.\n",
      "   - **Frequent Urination**: Known as polyuria, it occurs when excess glucose in the blood spills over into the urine, pulling water with it and leading to increased urination.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Medical History**:\n",
      "   - **History of High Blood Sugar**: This suggests that the patient may have had undiagnosed or poorly managed diabetes in the past.\n",
      "   - **Family History of Diabetes**: A strong risk factor for developing diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes or even type 1 diabetes in some cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Recent Lab Results**:\n",
      "   - **Elevated Blood Glucose Levels**: Indicates hyperglycemia, which is a key feature of diabetes.\n",
      "   - **Presence of Ketones in Urine**: The presence of ketones suggests that the body is using fat for energy due to inadequate glucose utilization, which is more characteristic of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), often seen in type 1 diabetes.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Analysis of Likely Diagnosis**:\n",
      "   - Considering the symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, and frequent urination, combined with elevated blood glucose and the presence of ketones, it points towards a significant metabolic disturbance.\n",
      "   - The combination of these factors, especially the presence of ketones, strongly suggests that the patient may be experiencing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which typically occurs in type 1 diabetes but can also occur in type 2 diabetes under extreme conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**: Given the symptoms, history, and lab findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Diabetes Mellitus, likely Type 1 Diabetes with Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Path 2:\n",
      "Based on the symptoms and history provided, let's analyze the information step by step to arrive at the most likely diagnosis:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Symptom Analysis**:\n",
      "    - **Fatigue**: This is a common symptom associated with various medical conditions, especially metabolic and endocrine disorders.\n",
      "    - **Weight Loss**: Unintentional weight loss can be indicative of diabetes, especially if it's accompanied by other symptoms of hyperglycemia.\n",
      "    - **Frequent Urination**: This symptom (polyuria) is often associated with diabetes due to osmotic diuresis caused by elevated blood glucose levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Medical History**:\n",
      "    - **History of High Blood Sugar**: This suggests that the patient may have had issues with glucose metabolism in the past, making them more susceptible to diabetes.\n",
      "    - **Family History of Diabetes**: A family history of diabetes increases the likelihood of the patient developing the condition, suggesting a genetic predisposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Lab Results**:\n",
      "    - **Elevated Blood Glucose Levels**: This is a key indicator of diabetes. High blood glucose can lead to the symptoms described.\n",
      "    - **Presence of Ketones in the Urine**: The presence of ketones indicates that the body is breaking down fat for energy instead of glucose. This is often seen in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious condition that can occur in patients with uncontrolled diabetes, particularly Type 1 diabetes.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Potential Diagnoses**:\n",
      "    - **Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus**: This condition typically presents in younger individuals, but can occur at any age. It is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. The symptoms of weight loss, fatigue, polyuria, elevated blood glucose, and presence of ketones strongly suggest this diagnosis.\n",
      "    - **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus**: While this is more common and can also present with similar symptoms, the presence of ketones and the acute nature of the symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, frequent urination) may suggest the patient is experiencing a more severe metabolic disturbance, often seen in Type 1.\n",
      "    - **Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)**: This is a serious condition that can occur as a complication of diabetes, particularly in Type 1. It is characterized by hyperglycemia, ketonuria, and acidosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Conclusion**:\n",
      "Given the combination of symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, frequent urination), the patient's history (high blood sugar, family history of diabetes), and the lab results (elevated blood glucose and ketones in urine), the most likely diagnosis is **Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus**, potentially presenting with **Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)**. This diagnosis is supported by the acute presentation of symptoms and the presence of ketones, which indicates significant metabolic derangement often associated with Type 1 diabetes.\n",

      "Path 3:\n",
      "Based on the information provided, let's analyze the symptoms and history to arrive at a likely diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Symptoms Analysis**:\n",
      "   - **Fatigue**: This can be a common symptom in various conditions, especially those affecting metabolism.\n",
      "   - **Weight Loss**: Unintentional weight loss can occur in diabetes due to the body using fat and muscle for energy when glucose is not effectively utilized.\n",
      "   - **Frequent Urination (Polyuria)**: This symptom is commonly associated with diabetes, as high blood glucose levels can lead to increased urination due to osmotic diuresis.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Medical History**:\n",
      "   - The patient has a **history of high blood sugar** and a **family history of diabetes**. This increases the risk of developing diabetes-related complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Recent Lab Results**:\n",
      "   - **Elevated Blood Glucose Levels**: High blood sugar is a key indicator of diabetes. \n",
      "   - **Presence of Ketones in Urine**: The presence of ketones suggests that the body is breaking down fat for energy due to insufficient insulin availability, which is common in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consideration of Potential Diagnoses**:\n",
      "   - Given the combination of elevated blood glucose levels, presence of ketones, and the symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, and polyuria, the most likely diagnosis is **Diabetes Mellitus**, specifically **Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus** or **Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)**.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Reasoning Towards Type 1 Diabetes**:\n",
      "   - Type 1 Diabetes is characterized by the body’s inability to produce insulin, often leading to acute symptoms and the presence of ketones in the urine. The patient's age (if young) and the rapid onset of symptoms support this diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Conclusion**:\n",
      "   - The most likely diagnosis for this patient, considering the symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, frequent urination, history of high blood sugar, family history of diabetes, and lab results showing elevated blood glucose and ketones, is **Diabetes Mellitus, likely Type 1 Diabetes with Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)**. \n",
      "\n",
      "Immediate medical evaluation and intervention would be warranted to manage the patient's condition effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Path 4:\n",
      "Based on the provided information, let’s analyze the patient's symptoms and history step by step:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Symptoms**: \n",
      "   - **Fatigue**: This can be a common symptom of uncontrolled diabetes or metabolic disorders.\n",
      "   - **Weight loss**: Unintentional weight loss, especially in the context of diabetes, can indicate that the body is not utilizing glucose properly for energy and is instead breaking down fat and muscle.\n",
      "   - **Frequent urination (polyuria)**: This is often seen in cases of high blood sugar levels, where excess glucose in the blood spills over into the urine, drawing water with it and causing increased urination.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Medical History**:\n",
      "   - **History of high blood sugar**: This suggests that the patient may have had pre-diabetes or undiagnosed diabetes previously.\n",
      "   - **Family history of diabetes**: A strong family history increases the likelihood of the patient having a genetic predisposition to diabetes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Recent Lab Results**:\n",
      "   - **Elevated blood glucose levels**: High blood glucose levels are a hallmark of diabetes mellitus.\n",
      "   - **Presence of ketones in the urine**: The presence of ketones indicates that the body is breaking down fat for energy instead of glucose, which can occur in uncontrolled diabetes, particularly in type 1 diabetes or in advanced cases of type 2 diabetes.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Integrating the information**:\n",
      "   - The combination of fatigue, weight loss, frequent urination, elevated blood glucose levels, and the presence of ketones strongly suggests that the patient is experiencing a metabolic derangement due to diabetes.\n",
      "   - Given the presence of ketones, this points toward a more severe form of diabetes, such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is typically associated with type 1 diabetes but can also occur in type 2 diabetes under stress conditions or when insulin levels are insufficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Conclusion**:\n",
      "   - Considering the symptoms, lab findings, and history, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is **Diabetes Mellitus**, likely **Type 1 Diabetes** or potentially **Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)** if the condition is severe and acute.\n",

      "\n",
      "Path 5:\n",
      "Based on the information provided, let's analyze the symptoms and history step by step to arrive at the most likely diagnosis:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Patient Symptoms**:\n",
      "   - **Fatigue**: This can be a common symptom associated with various conditions, but in the context of elevated blood sugar, it can indicate poor glucose utilization by the body.\n",
      "   - **Weight Loss**: This can occur in diabetes when the body starts to use fat and muscle for energy due to insufficient insulin or insulin resistance.\n",
      "   - **Frequent Urination**: Known as polyuria, this is a classic symptom of diabetes due to osmotic diuresis caused by high blood sugar levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Medical History**:\n",
      "   - The patient has a **history of high blood sugar**, which suggests a predisposition to diabetes or possibly uncontrolled diabetes.\n",
      "   - A **family history of diabetes** increases the likelihood of the patient developing diabetes, particularly Type 2 diabetes, although Type 1 diabetes can also have a genetic component.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Recent Lab Results**:\n",
      "   - **Elevated blood glucose levels**: This indicates hyperglycemia, which is a hallmark of diabetes.\n",
      "   - **Presence of ketones in the urine**: The presence of ketones suggests that the body is in a state of ketosis, which occurs when the body is breaking down fat for energy instead of glucose. This is commonly seen in uncontrolled diabetes, particularly in Type 1 diabetes, where there is a lack of insulin.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Possible Diagnoses**:\n",
      "   - **Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus**: This would explain the presence of ketones, significant weight loss, and the patient's symptoms. It typically presents with acute onset and can occur in younger individuals.\n",
      "   - **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus**: This is more common and could also explain the symptoms, particularly if the patient is older, but it usually does not present with ketones unless the diabetes is poorly controlled or in a state of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Conclusion**:\n",
      "   - Given the combination of symptoms (fatigue, weight loss, frequent urination), the history of high blood sugar, family history of diabetes, and the presence of ketones in the urine, the most likely diagnosis is **Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus**. However, it is also important to consider the possibility of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with a significant risk of developing DKA, especially if the patient has a history of elevated blood sugar and is relatively young.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Purpose and Scope of the Application\n",
    "- Clearly define the goals of the application (e.g., medical diagnosis, legal analysis, customer support).\n",
    "- Ensure the problem domain is well-suited for reasoning and deliberation, benefiting from SC methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Prompt Engineering\n",
    "- **Design a clear and structured prompt**: Include step-by-step reasoning instructions to guide the model effectively.\n",
    "  - Example: `\"Summarize the symptoms, correlate them with possible causes, and provide the most likely diagnosis.\"`\n",
    "- Use **domain-specific language** to increase precision.\n",
    "  - Example: Include terms like \"ketones,\" \"elevated glucose levels,\" or \"Type 1 diabetes\" for medical applications.\n",
    "- Encourage **exploration of alternatives** in the prompt.\n",
    "  - Example: `\"Consider all possible conditions that fit these symptoms and evaluate them before concluding.\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Diversity of Reasoning Paths\n",
    "- Generate diverse outputs by experimenting with:\n",
    "  - **Temperature Settings**: Use high `T` (e.g., 0.7–1.0) for creativity and low `T` (e.g., 0.1–0.3) for determinism.\n",
    "  - **Top-p Sampling**: Adjust `p` (e.g., 0.9) to control the diversity of generated tokens.\n",
    "- Create multiple prompts or prompt variations for the same query to elicit different reasoning paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Ensuring Adequate Context\n",
    "- **Chunk large datasets**: For tasks like medical diagnosis with an EMR/EHR system, divide patient records into smaller, relevant chunks (e.g., medications, lab results, imaging reports).\n",
    "- Use **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to fetch and pass only the relevant context for the query.\n",
    "  - Example: Combine FAISS/Chroma for indexing and retrieval.\n",
    "- Ensure proper **contextual grounding** by explicitly citing sources or references in prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Generation of Responses\n",
    "- **Number of Candidates**:\n",
    "  - Experiment with generating 5–10 candidate responses for robust SC analysis.\n",
    "- **Balance Output Length**:\n",
    "  - Avoid overly verbose reasoning that might dilute key points.\n",
    "- Consider **multi-turn dialogues**:\n",
    "  - Example: Allow iterative clarifications to refine responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Evaluation Metrics for Self-Consistency\n",
    "- **Frequency Voting**:\n",
    "  - Identify the most frequent outcome across all reasoning paths.\n",
    "- **Semantic Similarity**:\n",
    "  - Use tools like `spaCy` or `SentenceTransformers` to measure the similarity of conclusions, identifying consistent outputs with semantic overlap.\n",
    "- **Domain-Specific Metrics**:\n",
    "  - Evaluate based on specific KPIs, such as diagnostic accuracy for medical use or legal correctness in legal applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Handling Ambiguities\n",
    "- **Encourage uncertainty quantification**:\n",
    "  - Example: Include prompts asking for confidence levels or listing assumptions.\n",
    "- Create fallbacks for **low-consensus cases**:\n",
    "  - Notify users or require manual review when consistency is below a threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. Integration with External Systems\n",
    "- Use APIs to **fetch data dynamically** from databases like EMR/EHR systems or other knowledge bases.\n",
    "- Implement **validation layers** for domain-specific checks (e.g., cross-referencing diagnoses with lab findings).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. Optimizing for Cost and Latency\n",
    "- Optimize the number of SC iterations and candidate responses to balance quality with compute resources.\n",
    "- Use **cheaper models for initial reasoning** and premium models (e.g., GPT-4) for critical paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10. Iterative Testing and Refinement\n",
    "- Test prompts rigorously with domain experts to fine-tune reasoning steps and accuracy.\n",
    "- Conduct regular **failure case analyses**:\n",
    "  - Investigate why SC outputs fail or provide inconsistent answers and refine accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 11. Explainability and Transparency\n",
    "- Provide clear explanations for final outputs:\n",
    "  - Example: `\"The diagnosis is Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus because it aligns with the symptoms and lab results, and it appeared most frequently in generated responses.\"`\n",
    "- Use **traceable SC logs** to audit reasoning paths for critical domains like healthcare and law.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 12. Ethical Considerations\n",
    "- Ensure compliance with domain-specific regulations (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare).\n",
    "- Clearly disclose the limitations of SC-based reasoning to users:\n",
    "  - Example: `\"This diagnosis is based on probabilistic reasoning and should be validated by a healthcare professional.\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these considerations, practitioners can effectively design robust and practical SC-based applications for diverse use cases while maintaining reliability, accuracy, and user trust.\n"

    "#### Self-Consistency in LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-Consistency** is a technique where multiple responses (or chains of thought) are generated by the same LLM for a given query. These responses are then compared to find the most consistent answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "While we use a **separate evaluator** to compare the outputs, the term **\"self-consistency\"** still holds for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Self-Assessment\n",
    "The LLM generates multiple possible solutions independently, without human intervention. It performs a form of self-assessment by producing different reasoning paths and checking if they lead to the same or similar answers. This is akin to the model evaluating its own reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Model-Driven Comparison\n",
    "Although an external evaluator is used to compare the outputs, the core idea of self-consistency is that the comparison is based solely on the **model's own outputs**. The model's reasoning is still central to the process, and the evaluator only helps identify the most consistent result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Algorithmic Consistency\n",
    "The evaluator algorithm simply compares the different chains of thought generated by the model. It helps to highlight which responses are consistent, but the key point is that the model generates multiple answers based on its own reasoning. The external evaluator does not influence the reasoning process; it merely aids in finding the consistent answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "So, while the evaluation of consistency is external, the **self-consistency** concept emphasizes that the reasoning is generated internally by the model, and the evaluator’s role is to identify the most consistent output from those generated by the model itself.\n"
